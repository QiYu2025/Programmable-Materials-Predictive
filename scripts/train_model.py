train_model.py

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Initialize and train a Dynamic Morphology Engine (DME) model.
2. Train an SIDP (Stimulus-Informed Design Paradigm) model.
3. Optionally integrate both models for coordinated training or data exchange.

Adjust the placeholder methods and data flows for your actual project requirements.
