# my-predictive-modeling-project

A predictive modeling framework focusing on programmable materials, 3D reconstruction trajectories, and data-driven paradigms. This project explores:
- Dynamic Morphology Engine (DME) for algorithmic control and optimization
- Stimulus-Informed Design Paradigm (SIDP) for modeling how external stimuli affect programmable materials

The goal is to enable accurate trajectory prediction and robust material response simulation under changing environmental conditions.

### Highlights

1. DME (Dynamic Morphology Engine)
   - Located in src/dynamic_morphology_engine/.
   - Core logic in dme_core.py, with controllers and optimizers in dedicated files.
   - Responsible for handling the overall simulation, updates, and trajectory predictions.

2. SIDP (Stimulus-Informed Design Paradigm)
   - Located in src/stimulus_informed_design/.
   - sidp_core.py focuses on data-driven modeling between stimuli and material responses.
   - interaction.py manages how external stimuli influence the material state.

3. Data Management
   - data/raw/ contains original or unprocessed data.
   - data/processed/ holds transformed datasets after preprocessing.
   - See data/README.md for detailed explanations of data sources, formats, and preprocessing steps.

4. Scripts
   - data_preprocessing.py handles data cleaning and feature engineering
   - train_model.py orchestrates training for both DME and SIDP models
   - evaluate_model.py loads trained models to compute metrics and visualize results
   - utils/ holds shared utility functions

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-predictive-modeling-project.git
   cd my-predictive-modeling-project

2. Install Dependencies
   - Option A: Using requirements.txt
     pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Option B: Using setup.py
     python setup.py install

3. Data Preparation
   - Place raw datasets in the data/raw/ directory
   - Run the preprocessing script:
     python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
   - The script will generate processed data in data/processed/

4. Train Models
   python scripts/train_model.py
   - Initializes and trains the Dynamic Morphology Engine (DME)
   - Trains the SIDP model on prepared data
   - Optionally saves trained models or checkpoints

5. Evaluate Models
   python scripts/evaluate_model.py
   - Loads previously trained models
   - Runs evaluation against test or validation sets
   - Prints or saves performance metrics, visualizations, etc.

6. Run Main Entry (Optional)
   - If src/main.py is set up for direct command-line execution, you can run:
     python src/main.py
